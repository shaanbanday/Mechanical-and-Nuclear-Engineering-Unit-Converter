# Engineering Unit Conversion Tool

This Python-based console application provides a comprehensive set of engineering unit converters, covering length, mass, pressure, energy, power, torque, radiation dose, and radioactivity. Designed for engineers, students, and technical professionals.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

The program includes the following conversion modules:

- **Length** (meters, feet, inches, centimeters)
- **Mass** (kilograms, pounds, grams, ounces)
- **Pressure** (kPa, psi, bar, atm)
- **Energy** (joules, kilowatt-hours)
- **Power** (watts, horsepower)
- **Torque** (newton-meters, foot-pounds)
- **Radiation Dose** (sieverts, REM, roentgens)
- **Radioactivity** (becquerel, curie)

## ðŸ§° How It Works

The program presents a main menu for selecting a category, followed by sub-options for specific conversions. User inputs a value, and the program returns the converted result.

All conversions are handled using predefined constants for accuracy and clarity.
